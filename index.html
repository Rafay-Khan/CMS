								WORKING:
								This device works using Wi-Fi module that is programmed  through micro controller that program indicates which switch to open and which to close the program language is c++ arduino the picture shown below is of Node MCU ESP 8826
								In this chip there are digital signals which can be used for digital input as well as output we are using that circuit as digital output we will provide 5V of current as input that will ultimately provide that current to the circuit we can provide current to the circuit by two ways using a regulator of 5 v or by using the USB cable the output coming from development board is a very low signal the signal is not capable to operate the relay board which we used as electronic switch that switches are on and off through signal and the signal is provided through the development board in which Wi-Fi module and microcontroller are installed the electronic the electronic signal need 5V to function but the signals provided by the board is of 3.3 to cope with that we use transistors which work as an  amplifier which will enhance the signal and provide it to the electronic switches the picture shown below is of a relay board
						</div>
						<div class="cont-1">
								we will transfer the signal to the  transistor through a resistance the  signal first will be step down using the resistance and then transfer it to the transistor working as an amplifier and that signal will be enhanced and provided to the relay board that will be 5V signal and the relays can work. Now the transistors has three parts
								•	Base
								•	Collector 
								•	Emitter
								As shown above we have connected the base of the transistor with two resistance one of 1k that is dealing with positive voltage and the other resistance is of 4.7k from where we are providing the signal we are providing input at emitter and getting output at collector the input we are providing is –ve 3.3V and the output we are getting is –ve 5V all the emitters of transistors are connected together creating a channel and they are connected to ground –ve and   we have connect that track with a diode to save it from reverse current we will create an account on EASYIOT CLOUD APP through the program we will create four electronic switches as module and then we will provide the signal through the Wi-Fi to the controller and then the whole unit will work  
								APPLICATIONS:
								•	More efficient and convenient 
								•	Cheaper and reliable
								•	Save electricity
